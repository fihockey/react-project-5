## React Project - Punk API

This project is a website that allows you to search through the all the beers located within the Punk API and was made using React/TypeScript and CSS/SCSS. The aim of the project was to build a user friendly website to allow users to explore the beers displayed within the Punk API, using a searchbox and filters.

## Project Goals

1. **Build A Website Using React** The main task is to create a website using React. This will test your understanding of React / TypeScript and how to break down a problem.
2. **Build A Searchbox** Make it so you can search the beers by their name, and the page content should update as you type each letter in the box.
3. **Create Filters** Make it so you can filter the content on three conditions:
   High Alcohol (ABV value greater than 6%)
   Classic Range (Was first brewed before 2010)
   High Acidity (pH lower than 4)
4. **Practice Using Git and GitHub Flow** This project gives the opertunity to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line.
5. **Improve Understanding of Scoping Larger Projects** Produce a clear plan of what you're going to build and how, acknowledging the differences from previous projects as this project is to be solely built within React.
6. **Application of Learning** This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on all of the course so far.
